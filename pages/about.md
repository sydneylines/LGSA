## About the Archive
The Laura Goodman Salverson Archive (LGSA) is an ongoing project to digitize and collect Salverson's extant ouevre. The archive is managed and directed by Sydney Lines, who is currently writing her dissertation on Laura Goodman Salverson. Like Laura, Sydney is also a Western Icelander whose family emigrated to North America.
